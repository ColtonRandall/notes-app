# Notes App üìù

A full-stack Java/Spring Boot + React notes app where you can create, view, delete personal notes.

The idea was to build a structure similar to [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com), with a Mason Jar layout where notes stack on top of each other to fill the whitespace created by larger notes.

## Stack

- [Backend](https://github.com/ColtonRandall/notes-app/tree/main/backend): Java 24 + Spring Boot
- [Frontend](https://github.com/ColtonRandall/notes-app/tree/main/frontend): React + Vite

## Features

- Create notes with a title and content
- View all notes
- Delete a note
- Update an existing note
